dashboard for sleep data

This dashboard is to promote consistent sleep pattern in order to improve sleep quality under the assumption that the more consistent
one's sleep time is, the better one's sleep quality is. 

The key metric, "Inconsistency Measure" is calculated weekly by taking the standard deviation (in minutes) of the sleep start time from Sunday to Saturday. In plot2, Inconsistency Measure for the past 6 months is presented in a box-whisker plot with the most recent 4 weeks' Inconsistency Measures marked with red and black squares varying in size.

In plot1, sleep start time are grouped by day of the week (DOW) and presented in box-whisker plots with the most recent recording marked with red squares. Also in plot1, an average of the most recent 7 recordings of sleep start time is presented in a dashed line in order to show each of the 7 most recent recordings' deviations from the mean.
